AI & Data Structures Projects

This repository includes a collection of academic and practice projects related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Structures, implemented in Python and C++.

🔍 AI Search Algorithms (Python)

1. N-Puzzle Solver (Final-N-Puzzle.py)

Solves the classic 8-puzzle or 15-puzzle problem.

Implements search algorithms:

A* (A-star) with Manhattan distance heuristic

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Easy to extend for other puzzle sizes.

▶️ How to Run

python Final-N-Puzzle.py

2. Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) (Final-TSP.py)

Solves the TSP using heuristic search methods.

Reads input from a distance matrix or coordinates.

Outputs the optimal or near-optimal tour.

▶️ How to Run

python Final-TSP.py

3. Helper Functions (qu.py)

Contains shared or utility functions that assist other Python files.

🧱 Data Structure Project (C++)

Linked List Implementation (LinkList-project.cpp)

Classic implementation of a singly linked list.

Basic operations include:

Insertion (at beginning, end, and at position)

Deletion

Displaying the list

▶️ How to Compile & Run (Linux/MacOS)

g++ LinkList-project.cpp -o linkedlist
./linkedlist

▶️ On Windows (using MinGW or similar)

g++ LinkList-project.cpp -o linkedlist.exe
linkedlist.exe
